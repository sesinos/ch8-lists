# Exercise 1: creating and accessing lists
# Create a vector `my_breakfast` of everything you ate for breakfast

# Create a vector `my_lunch` of everything you ate (or will eat) for lunch

### Challenge ###
# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use the `lappy()` function to apply the `length()` function to each item
items <- lapply(meals, length)
# Write a function `add_pizza` that adds pizza to a given meal vector, and
# returns the pizza-fied vector
add_pizza <- function(meal) {
meal <- c(meal, "pizza")
meal # return the new vector
}
# Create a vector `better_meals` that is all your meals, but with pizza!
better_meals <- lapply(meals, add_pizza)
# Exercise 1: creating data frames
# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in the first 4 games
# of the season (google "Seahawks" for the scores!)
points <- c(12, 3, 37, 27) #example from 2016 season
# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahwaks have allowed to be scored
# against them in each of the first 4 games of the season
points_allowed <- c(10, 9, 18, 17)
# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe called `games`
games <- data.frame(points, points_allowed)
# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points between the teams
# Hint: recall the syntax for assigning new elements (which in this case will be
# a vector) to a list!
games$diff <- games$points - games$points_allowed
# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks won the game
games$won <- games$diff > 0
# Create a vector of the opponent names corresponding to the games played
opponents <- c("dolphins", "rams", "49ers", "jets")
# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
rownames(games) <- opponents
# View your data frame to see how it has changed!
